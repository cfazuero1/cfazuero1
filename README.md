# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianazuero/">Christian Azuero</a>'s Cybersecurity & GRC Project Portfolio 🔐

I’m a Cybersecurity Specialist with over 5 years of experience in SOC operations, firewall auditing, and governance, risk & compliance (GRC).  
I enjoy building hands-on labs, conducting investigations, and creating projects that strengthen security operations while aligning with industry frameworks such as ISO 27001 and NIST CSF.  

Please feel free to explore my work — each project reflects my dedication to threat detection, compliance, and defensive security.
