I’m a Cybersecurity Specialist with over 5 years of experience in SOC operations, firewall auditing, and governance, risk & compliance (GRC).  
I enjoy building hands-on labs, conducting investigations, and creating projects that strengthen security operations while aligning with industry frameworks such as ISO 27001 and NIST CSF.
